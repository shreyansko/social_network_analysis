It is calculated as the sum of the proportion of each religion (whether Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, None, and Other) in the social network. A H-H Index closer to 0 implies that the Ego's social circle is very diverse in terms of religious identity. A larger H-H index (closer to 1) indicates more similarlity (less diversity) in the social network in terms of religious identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pct_None is simply the percentage of one's social circle with no religion; it ranges from 0% to 100%. The H-H Index, on the other hand, is a better measure for calculating religious diversity since it incorporates the proportion of all the religions (all in the scope of this study means Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, None, or Other) in a network. The H-H Index measure captures a lot more nuance in the relationship between Ego's religious identity and preferences, and that of their social circle. We would prefer to use H-H Index since it actually captures religious diversity in a social circle, whereas Pct_None only captures those people in the network who don't follow any religion and groups all other categories (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Other) together.\n",

    "It is important for the researcher to control for ego's degree/size because the size could very directly influence the religious diversity of one's social circle: more people you know, more likley you are to know people who follow different religons than you, and less people you know, less likely are you to know people with religious preferences different from yours.\n",

    "In both Model 1 and Model 2, the researchers are right to include Numgiven because this allows them to exclude the possibility that the religious diversity or the proportion of people not following any religion in a social circle is being influenced by the size of that network. The properites of regression allow us to hold numgiven constant as we analyze the effects of other variables (like None, or Educ, etc.) on the outcome variable. If we didn't include Numgiven, we would have failed to account for how the relationship between the outcome and the independent variables could differ for Egos with different degrees/sizes of social networks, solely because of having more/less people in the network. We can see from the summary statistics that the size of the network varies from 0 to 6: there are some people who don't have anyone in their network, and there are others who have up to 6 people listed in their network.\n",

    "### 4) Explain to me what structural holes are. Why does Burt think they are so important? Why is his measure of “constraint” a good proxy for what structural holes are meant to be? In the context of sending messages and getting papers cited, do you think having lots of structural holes would be useful to scientists here? Why? Why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural holes are non-redundant ties that connect disparate social clusters. In social networks, structural holes exist when there is an absence of a direct tie between two nodes/entities. The theory behind structural holes was developed by Ronald Burt in the context of good ideas and within-firm competition. According to Burt, people/nodes within a group are more likely to think homogenously in the presence of structural holes since there would be a restriction on free flow of information between different groups. In tightly clustered networks, there would be redundance in terms of ideas and information. Following this logic, people connected across groups are in a beneficial position to get access to alternative ways of thinking. An individual who is able to form a brokerage between different clustered groups could facilitate the transfer of information that seems mundane to one group but innovative to another.$^{1}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Burt's study concluded that Managers that operated near (bridged/brokered) structural hole(s) had the greatest chance of having \"good ideas\". Managers who had a lot of contacts outside their immediate work groups were the ones whose ideas were ranked highest. These managers were well positioned in their company because of the structural holes in their networks that restrictred flow of ideas between groups, except for through them. The manager existing near a structural hole, that is, a manager well-connected with people outside of their group also have less duplication of indformation because of their connection to unique (non-redundant) nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The constraint of a network can be calculated as the sum of each connection's constraints. It measures the extent to which your network time and energy is concentrated in a single group. Constraints are a good measure of structural holes because they directly capture how much an ego can negotiate/exploit potential structural holes in their network for their own benefit. An ego who acts as a bridge (in the case of less constraints and more structural holes) will be better off than other people in their network because of informational benefits and tertius gaudens; more people would depend on the ego for connections to other groups and different (read:new) ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of sending messages and getting papers cited, I think having lots of structural holes and less constrations would be very useful to scientists since the ideas that a well-connected scientist would get access to from one group would be \"unique\" for other groups. I suspect scientists to have clustered networks- scientists from an academic field would be more likely to be connected closely with other scientists from that same academic field. In the presence of structural holes, the network would be less-redundant (and sparsely connected), which means less people would be sharing ideas across academic disciplines/departments. Any scientist that is in a beneficial position of \"bridging/brokering\" between unconnected groups would get access to innovative/new ideas that they could publish articles on. This would get those well-connected / brokering scientists more citations since there would be limited journal articles on that new topic in their department. However, the structural holes would ONLY be useful for those scientists that act as the bridge between the unconnected groups. \n",

More connected alters would inflict a higher constraint on the ego. \n",

As explained above, more connections between the alters would result in the ego not being abe to take advantage of any structural holes in the network. A more dense network would facilitate free flow of ideas and information between nodes from different departments/disciplines/groups. No one node would be able to act as a bridge/broker between nodes and utilize their connections to get access to ideas that others their groups in a sparse network would not have had access to. \n",
